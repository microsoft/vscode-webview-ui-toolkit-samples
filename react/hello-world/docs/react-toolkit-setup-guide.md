- Create and configure a React app for being used in a webview using `create-react-app`
  - Special configuration so that build files can be consumed by/used in extension webview
- Configure extension so that the build files of the React app get consumed by the webview
- Install and use `@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit/react` within React source code
  - Special configuration so that toolkit components can work within React code
