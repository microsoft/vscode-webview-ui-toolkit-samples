# Webview UI Toolkit Sample Extensions

This is a repository containing all the sample extensions for the [Webview UI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-toolkit). Each sample is a self contained extension and demonstrates some aspect of the toolkit and/or the [VS Code API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api) in relation to the toolkit. You can read, play with, or adapt these samples to create your own extensions.

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system to run the examples. It is recommended to use the Node version used for VS Code development itself which is documented [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#prerequisites).

## Usage

- `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit-samples.git`
- `code <any-sample-folder>`
- `npm install` in the terminal, then `F5` to run the sample
- Alternatively, follow the instructions in each of the sample's README for setting up and running the sample
