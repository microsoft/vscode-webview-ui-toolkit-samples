# Webview UI Toolkit Sample Extensions

This repository contains all the sample extensions for the [Webview UI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-toolkit).

Each sample is a self-contained extension, and demonstrates some aspect of the toolkit and/or the [Visual Studio Code API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api) in relation to the toolkit. You can read, play with, or adapt these samples to create your own extensions.

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system to run the samples. We recommend you use the Node version used for Visual Studio Code development itself, which is documented [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#prerequisites).

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the `README` file of the desired sample extension.
